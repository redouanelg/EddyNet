SSH data come from "GLOBAL OCEAN GRIDDED L4 SEA SURFACE HEIGHTS AND DERIVED VARIABLES REPROCESSED (1993-ONGOING)" distibuted by CMEMS: http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_047

SSH data I used here were obtained in 2016 from AVISO, I am not aware if there were any changes since then. In any case, you can use another source of SSH data, and retrain EddyNet.
